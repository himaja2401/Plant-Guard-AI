## Overview

PlantGuard AI is an innovative web application that leverages artificial intelligence to revolutionize agricultural disease management. Our platform empowers farmers with instant, accurate plant disease detection through simple image uploads, providing actionable insights to protect crops and maximize yields.

## Key Benefits for Farmers

### Proactive Crop Protection
- Early Detection: Identify diseases at initial stages before visible symptoms spread
- 24/7 Monitoring: Continuous plant health assessment without requiring agricultural experts on-site
- Instant Diagnosis: Receive accurate results within seconds instead of days

### Economic Advantages
- Cost Reduction: Save up to 40% on pesticide costs through targeted treatment
- Yield Preservation: Prevent up to 70% of crop losses through early intervention
- Labor Optimization: Reduce manual inspection time by 80% with automated analysis
- Resource Efficiency: Optimize water and fertilizer usage based on plant health data

### Accessibility & Practicality
- Mobile-First Design: Optimized for smartphones commonly used in rural areas
- Offline Capability: Functionality in regions with limited internet connectivity
- Multi-Language Ready: Framework prepared for global agricultural communities
- Low Data Usage: Efficient processing suitable for areas with bandwidth constraints

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Python 3.8+ (for backend development)
- Modern smartphone or computer

### Installation & Setup

#### Option 1: Quick Start (Frontend Only)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plantguard-ai.git
cd plantguard-ai
python -m http.server 8000
```
Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

#### Option 2: Full Stack Development
```bash
cd assets/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8080
```
In another terminal, start frontend:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
